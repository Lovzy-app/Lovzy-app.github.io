                Information if anyone decided to use my Service.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to

            </p>
            <p>

            <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
            <p>
                For a better experience, while using our Service, I may require you to provide us with certain
                personally identifiable information, including but not limited to :

                In addition to the personal data that we collect directly from you, we
                also use a third-party authentication provider called Supabase to manage
                user authentication. When you use our website, Supabase may collect
                personal data about you, such as your email address and authentication
                credentials. For more information about Supabase's data practices, please

            <h2>Log Data</h2>
            <p>
                I want to inform you that whenever you
                use my Service, in a case of an error in the app
                I collect data and information (through third-party
                products) on your phone called Log Data. This Log Data may
                include information such as your device Internet Protocol
                (“IP”) address, device name, operating system version, the
                configuration of the app when utilizing my Service,
                the time and date of your use of the Service, and other
                statistics.
            </p>
            <h2>Cookies</h2>
            <p>
                Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are
                commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent
                to your browser from the websites that you visit and are
                stored on your device's internal memory.
            </p>
            <p>
                This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However,
                the app may use third-party code and libraries that use
                “cookies” to collect information and improve their services.
                You have the option to either accept or refuse these cookies
                and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you
                choose to refuse our cookies, you may not be able to use some
                portions of this Service.
            </p>
            <h2>Service Providers</h2>
            <p>
                I may employ third-party companies and
                individuals due to the following reasons:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>To facilitate our Service;</li>
                <li>To provide the Service on our behalf;</li>
                <li>To perform Service-related services; or</li>
                <li>To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                I want to inform users of this Service
                that these third parties have access to their Personal
                Information. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to
                them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to
                disclose or use the information for any other purpose.
            </p>
            <h2>Security</h2>
            <p>
                I value your trust in providing us your
                Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially
                acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method
                of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic
                storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot
                guarantee its absolute security.
            </p>
            <h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>
            <p>
                This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on
                a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note
                that these external sites are not operated by me.
                Therefore, I strongly advise you to review the
                Privacy Policy of these websites. I have
                no control over and assume no responsibility for the content,
                privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or
                services.

            <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
            <div>
                <p>
                    These Services do not address anyone under the age of 18.
                    I do not knowingly collect personally
                    identifiable information from children under 18 years of age. In the case
                    I discover that a child under 18 has provided
                    me with personal information, I immediately
                    delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian
                    and you are aware that your child has provided us with
                    personal information, please contact me so that
                    I will be able to do the necessary actions.
